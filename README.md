# A tower defense deckbuilder roguelike made with unity<br/>
### Project to be publically released for beta testing in a few months<br/>


## Fun dev facts
This will be my first ever full release of a game, but I plan on either starting new projects or continuing my older works<br/>
My perfectionism and my scope creep issue are responsible for the extended development time for this project<br/>
All art assets made in Piskel by me<br/>
All code written in C# by me<br/>
Heavily inspired by my experiences in Inscryption and BTD6<br/>
Name TBD, placeholder in use<br/>
