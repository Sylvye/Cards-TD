### Project to be publically released for beta testing in a few months  


## Fun dev facts
This will be my first ever full release of a game, but I plan on either starting new projects or continuing my older works  
My perfectionism and my scope creep issue are responsible for the extended development time for this project  
All art assets made in Piskel by me  
All code written in C# by me  
Heavily inspired by my experiences in Inscryption and BTD6  
Name TBD, placeholder in use
